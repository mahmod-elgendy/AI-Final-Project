# AI-Final-Project

## Overview
This project is the final assignment for the AI course, consisting of two major tasks:

1. **Search Algorithms for Self-Driving Cars**
   - Implemented search algorithms to find the best route for autonomous vehicles.
   - Handles obstacles and finds optimal paths in a 2D maze.
   - The approach can be extended to real-world GPS maps.

2. **Reinforcement Learning for Navigation**
   - Trained an AI model to navigate a grid environment.
   - The model learns by iterating, rewarding, and assigning values to each move.
   - The AI decides its own optimal path through reinforcement learning techniques.

## Features
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** A* Search, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, BFS, and DFS.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** AI efficiently avoids obstacles while navigating.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Uses reward-based decision-making for autonomous movement.
- **Scalability:** Can be adapted to work with real-world maps and navigation systems.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- OpenAI Gym (for reinforcement learning simulations)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Pygame (for 2D maze simulation)

## Future Improvements
- Integrating real-world GPS maps for self-driving simulations.
- Enhancing reinforcement learning with deep Q-learning.
- Improving search efficiency for large-scale environments.
